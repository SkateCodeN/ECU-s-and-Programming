# Programming-with-Python
The Journey Begins and this will be a diary of sorts
The date is 5-14-19

I am creating this readme file to be the beginning of the jouney that will be data science and python. Specifically I want to 
focus on data representation and machine learning. I will start with codeacademy and from there stem to youtube videos. 
Currently I am employed as a dish washer and my ambition is to learn and to keep coding. We are in the wonderful age of code.

Side note: A passion of mine has been writing, which is why I plan to write this passage of learning in a diary style.
