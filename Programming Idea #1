Concept: I want to write a program that can output data (log data) from my car to my phone/laptop and present it as graphs. 

Alright lets get into the logistics of breaking this problem down. 

The piece that we want to 'talk' to or rather get log information from is the Engine Control Unit(ECU).
This piece of equipment is responsible for controlling things such as A/F (air to fuel ratio) ignition timing, and many other 
functions of the car. If the car runs on sensors, MAF sensor, MAP, Coolant Temp, etc they talk to the ECU. 

Lets take a look further into what an ECU is...

// We talk about ECU's after i research them further



ODBII

The way we obtain log information and by log info I mean we can read what our A/F rations are, what the MAF is reading, 
what our coolant temp is and you get the gist. So we obtain this via whats called and ODB2 port. Mainly located under the steering wheel. 
This port allows for the connection of a special cable that can attach to your laptop. Also new tech has rendered ODB2 scanners 
to be wi-fi or bluetooth enabled to connect to your mobile device as well. 

ODBII is a protocol that is a standard to all manufacturers but be aware. Different manufacturers use different protocols. 

This will be updated further as the days and research move along. Sort of a collection of what I know and what I need to learn.
