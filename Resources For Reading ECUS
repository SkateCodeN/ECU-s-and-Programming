In have a cable that can have the D2XX Driver, this is an update for the FTDI cable devices that connect via the OBD port to the ECU.

Straight from the FTDI website we have this statement:
D2XX drivers allow direct access to the USB device through a DLL. 
"Application software can access the USB device through a series of DLL function calls."

They also graciously provide DLL functions call code:

*This is a plethora of function calls one can use. 
They also have a section for C# programming.

If I recal the nefmoto application is also written in C#.

So now I have a library to read data from the ECU. Can I read specific block data?
