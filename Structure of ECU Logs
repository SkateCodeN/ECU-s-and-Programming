Read Class: Reads File
		Reads Log and Header data
	ex of Header Data LINE: MARKER,VEHICLE SPEED,LAMDA-BANK 1, BOOST PRESSURE,...
	 	LOG DATA LINE : ,800,3.2,5.2,.....
	UNITS OF MEASURE LINE : ,rpm,%,mbar,....
	READS DATE OF LOGS
	READS TYPE OF VEHICLE
	MAIN CLASS USES THESE OUTPUTS TO BE USED BY THE FORM 

WRITE CLASS: Makes sence of the data
		We want to clean up each Header, each header is its own class with its Log Data
		Each Header has also a Unit of measure 
		Each Header Class also has a time Parameter associated...the time the ECU captured that specific log(block) parameter
		WE THEN USE THIS DATA STRUCTURE TO CREATE GRAPH ... RPM VS BLAH GRAPH	
								    TORQUE AND HP GRAPH
		WHAT ELSE DO WE WANT THE FORM TO DISPLAY?
		Graph, Parameters I can graph 
		Tell me Max values? ex of maf at what RPM Range...Ditto for boost
