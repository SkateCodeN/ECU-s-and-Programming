The audi tuning industry is plagued with a lot of secrets after the CAN protocol came into effect for 2008 Audi cars.

These cars whose ECUS are called ME9 are kept in secret and further research is required.

The nefmoto community caters mainly to B5, B6 S4 and A4 models. Hence these cars are the most versitile and modded. 
The ECU for this car is the ME7 or ME7.5.

In order for one to tune a car one needs to read the memory of the ECU(This is EEPROM) ehich is in hex. One also needs an XDF file 
or what they call a defenitions file that tells the tuning program where the locations for tuning are located. 

Because Bosch is the manufacturer of these ECU's one has to check the Bosch naming convections for what location of memoru refers to.
