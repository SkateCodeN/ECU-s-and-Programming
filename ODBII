OBD2 or OBDII

As stated previously ODBII is a protocol that is used my car manufactures and professionals to obtain (DTC's) and log data. 
OBD stands for On-Board Diagnostics and what it does is that it retreives Diagnostic Trouble Codes that the engine sees. 
The log data, which as stated before retrieves info from the sensors that the car has, can be captured and inspected to see 
engine performance.

I want to focus mainly on Audi and Subaru for my foundation of understanding DTC's and Engine performance. Why? mainly because my 
A4 is my daily driver and Subaru for my SO.
